GA Week 2 Micro Blog

This was created for the Micro-Blog project in Week 2 of General Assembly's WDI program.

I decided to create a Sloth Meme Blog, where a user can input a URL (an image of a sloth), add a caption, and ultimately view their own Sloth Meme.

02/01/2016
TODOs: 
1) Allow users to download images after they are created.
2) Allow users to delete posts.
3) Create a database of all sloth memes, so that everytime the page is refreshed, there are still the old memes. 
4) Fix buggy media queries in CSS:
   -Text doesn't smoothly get smaller as window size gets smaller
   -Images of different sizes tend to not always center correctly.
   -Centering of text boxes is off.
5) Allow users to "Upload file" from their own machines.
6) Create more visually appealing labels of "URL" and "Caption" on the left-hand size of the text input boxes.
